This project is an end-to-end UI automation testing framework built using Playwright, Cucumber (BDD), and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
It provides a scalable and maintainable approach for automated testing with detailed HTML reports for easy result analysis.

🚀 Features

✅ Playwright for fast, reliable browser automation
✅ Cucumber (BDD) for human-readable test scenarios (.feature files)
✅ Page Object Model (POM) for clean separation between test logic and UI interactions
✅ HTML Reports for detailed execution results
✅ Environment-based configuration (QA, Staging, Prod)
✅ Tag-based execution for selective test runs
✅ Screenshots on failure for easier debugging
✅ Cross-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or above)
npm or yarn
Git

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Install Playwright Browsers
npx playwright install

🧩 Running Tests
Run all tests
npm test

🧱 Reporting
After execution, an HTML report will be generated automatically in the reports/html-report directory.

🧠 Framework Design Highlights
🔹 BDD with Cucumber
Scenarios written in plain English using Given/When/Then format
Mapped to JavaScript step definitions under step_definitions

🔹 Page Object Model
Each UI page is represented as a class in /pages
Centralized locators and reusable methods for interactions

🔹 Hooks
hooks.js handles setup/teardown (e.g., browser context, screenshots)

🔄 CI/CD Integration
Easily integrates with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure Pipelines for automated test runs.
Typical steps include:
Checkout code
Install dependencies
Run tests
Publish HTML report as a build artifact

🧰 Technologies Used
Playwright – UI automation
Cucumber (BDD) – Scenario-driven testing
JavaScript – Strong typing and maintainability
cucumber-html-reporter / multiple-cucumber-html-reporter – Reporting
Node.js – Execution environment
